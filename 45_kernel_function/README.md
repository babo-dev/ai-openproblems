## Linear Kernel Function

Write a Python function kernel_function that computes the linear kernel between two input vectors x1 and x2. 
The linear kernel is defined as the dot product (inner product) of two vectors.

**Example:**

Input:
```python
import numpy as np

x1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
x2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

result = kernel_function(x1, x2)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
32
```

Reasoning:

The linear kernel between x1 and x2 is computed as:1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 32
