Convert Vector to Diagonal Matrix

Write a Python function to convert a 1D numpy array into a diagonal matrix. The function should take in a 1D numpy array x and return a 2D numpy array representing the diagonal matrix.

Example:
Input:
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    output = make_diagonal(x)
    print(output)
Output:
[[1. 0. 0.]
    [0. 2. 0.]
    [0. 0. 3.]]
Reasoning:
The input vector [1, 2, 3] is converted into a diagonal matrix where the elements of the vector form the diagonal of the matrix.
