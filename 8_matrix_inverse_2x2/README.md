### Calculate 2x2 Matrix Inverse

Write a Python function that calculates the inverse of a 2x2 matrix. Return 'None' 
if the matrix is not invertible.

**Example:**

Input:
```python
matrix = [[4, 7], [2, 6]]
```


Output:
```
[[0.6, -0.7], [-0.2, 0.4]]
```

Reasoning:

The inverse of a 2x2 matrix [a, b], [c, d] is given by (1/(ad-bc)) * [d, -b], [-c, a], 
provided ad-bc is not zero.
